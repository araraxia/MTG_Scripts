# MTG_Scripts
I wanted a convenient way to just dump all of my deck lists, or any list of cards into one pile to sift through. The original goal of this is to have a simple way to organize and view the cards in a unique list. I imagine there will be some other random stuff I feel like doing and I'll throw it into the same repo.

This leans heavily on the Scryfall API (https://scryfall.com/docs/api) for most of the legwork, if any other tools get dragged into this I will note them here as well.
